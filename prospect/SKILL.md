# SuperAGI Sales — Prospecting

Prospecting is how you find potential customers from SuperAGI's external database — these are NOT contacts already in your CRM. You search SuperAGI's database of people and companies, then save matches into your CRM (Leads/Companies) or add them directly to outreach Sequences. This is the top of the sales funnel: find people → enrich their data → reach out.

## Related Skills

| Skill | Relationship |
|-------|-------------|
| `crm/records` | "Add to Leads" and "Add to Companies" save prospects directly into CRM as Lead or Company records. Use `crm/records` to view, edit, or act on them after saving. |
| `crm/lists` | "Add to List" saves prospects into a named CRM List. The "Target Company Domains → Select a list" filter in Prospect Leads reads from saved company lists. Use `crm/lists` to manage those lists. |
| `sequences` | "Add to Sequence" from Prospect Leads drops leads directly into an outreach sequence. Use `sequences` to build those sequences first. |
| `cold-outreach/find-new-leads` | The ICP filters in Cold Outreach Step 1 mirror the Prospect Leads filter panel. Use `prospect` to manually validate which filters return the right leads before configuring a Cold Outreach campaign. |
| `workflows` | The "Prospect Leads" and "Prospect Companies" workflow nodes use the same filter criteria as this skill. Use `workflows` to automate prospect sourcing. |

## The Prospecting Pipeline

How prospecting connects to the rest of SuperAGI Sales:

```
1. FIND          → Prospect Leads (people) or Prospect Companies (orgs)
2. ENRICH        → Access Email/Phone on individual leads, or bulk via Data Enrichment CSV
3. SAVE          → Add to Leads (CRM), Add to List (for organization), or Add to Companies (CRM)
4. REACH OUT     → Add to Sequence (automated outreach) or Cold Outreach (one-off)
5. TRACK         → Signals alert you to buying intent; Website Visitors show who's browsing
6. MANAGE        → CRM Leads/Companies/Deals for pipeline management
```

**Key connections:**
- **Prospect Companies → Prospect Leads:** Find companies first, save to a list, then use that list in Prospect Leads' "Target Company Domains" > "Select a list" filter to find people at those companies
- **Prospect Leads → CRM:** "Add to Leads" moves prospects into CRM > Leads with auto email enrichment
- **Prospect Leads → Sequences:** "Add to Sequence" drops leads directly into automated outreach
- **Signals → Outreach prioritization:** Buying signals (funding, hiring, product launches) help you time outreach
- **Website Visitors → Immediate action:** See who's on your site and reach out via Email/Call/Sequence directly from the visitor detail panel

## Key Gotchas from the UI

1. **Filter expand/collapse:** Click the filter name text OR the toggle icon next to it — both work. The filter section collapses back to just the name when clicked again.
2. **Exclude toggles:** Most multi-select filters have an "Exclude" option below the combobox. This lets you exclude specific values (e.g., exclude the "Marketing" department).
3. **OR vs AND logic:** Technologies and Company Keywords filters have explicit "Include at least one (OR)" / "Include all (AND)" toggles. Default is OR.
4. **Target Company Domains extras:** This filter has three input methods — type domains manually, upload a CSV of domains, or select a saved list.
5. **AI Search vs Filter Search are separate modes:** They share the same results area but switching between them resets the other. You cannot combine AI search with manual filters.
6. **Access Email / Access Phone buttons:** These appear per-lead in results and cost enrichment credits. They reveal contact info inline without navigating away.
7. **"LEAD" badge on results:** Some prospect results show a "LEAD" badge and `lead_icon`, meaning this person is already in your CRM as a Lead.
8. **"existing_lead" badge on Website Visitors:** Similar indicator showing the visitor is already a CRM lead.
9. **Estimates count:** The total matching results number (e.g., "1,865 estimates") appears near the Select leads button — these are estimates, not exact counts.
10. **Funding Stage Date Range:** The Funding Stage filter has an additional "Date Range" sub-filter (defaults to "All Time") to scope by when the funding occurred.
11. **Company Find → No Sequences:** The Find Companies tab has "Add to Companies" but no "Add to Sequence" — sequences are for people, not companies.
12. **Signal wizard is 3 steps:** Signal Type → Audience Filters → Distribute Leads. You must complete all three to activate a signal.
13. **Data Enrichment types:** CSV uploads can be "CSV - People" or "CSV - Company" — you choose the type when uploading.
