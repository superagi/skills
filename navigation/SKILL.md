## 5. Core Sales Workflow

The typical sales workflow in SuperAGI follows this sequence:

### Step 1: Setup (one-time)
- **Connect mailboxes**: Settings → Personal Mailboxes (connect Gmail/Outlook for sending outreach)
- **Connect LinkedIn**: Settings → Personal LinkedIn
- **Create value prop templates**: Settings → Value Prop Templates (messaging used by AI SDR)
- **Configure outreach settings**: Settings → Email Campaign Settings

### Step 2: Find Leads (Prospecting)
- **Prospect → Prospect Leads** (`/prospect/find_leads`): Use filters or AI search to find matching leads by role, company, industry, location, company size, etc.
- **Prospect → Prospect Companies** (`/prospect/find_companies`): Search for companies, then find contacts within them
- **Prospect → Signals** (`/signals`): Monitor intent signals — job changes, funding rounds, news mentions, website visits

### Step 3: Enrich
- Auto-enrich email addresses when saving leads from Prospect
- **Data Enrichment** (`/data_enrichments`): Bulk enrich phone numbers, company data, and other fields

### Step 4: Save to CRM
- Save prospects to a **List** (CRM → Lists at `/list`) for organized outreach
- Or save directly to **CRM → Leads** (`/crm/leads`)
- Prospects become Leads once saved to CRM

### Step 5: Outreach (choose one approach)
- **Cold Outreach** (`/cold-outreach`): AI SDR handles prospecting + personalization + follow-ups at scale. Create a "Campaign" — the AI writes, sends, and follows up.
- **Sequences** (`/sequences`): Build manual multi-channel sequences with full control per step (email, LinkedIn, call, task). More hands-on than Cold Outreach.

### Step 6: Track & Respond
- **Unibox** (`/unibox`): Unified inbox — see replies across all channels (email, LinkedIn) in one place
- **Engage → Conversations** (`/conversations`): Conversation threads
- **Engage → Emails** (`/emails`): Email-specific tracking
- **Engage → LinkedIn** (`/linkedin/logs`): LinkedIn activity logs
- Campaign dashboards (within Cold Outreach/Sequences): Track Outputs, Replies, Opens, Analytics

### Step 7: Convert
- Move engaged leads to **CRM → Deals** (`/crm/deals`): Create deal records, manage through pipeline stages
- **CRM → CRM Tasks** (`/tasks`): Track follow-up tasks
- **CRM → Contacts** (`/crm/contacts`): Full contact records with activity history

### Step 8: Analyze
- **Analyze → Analytics** (`/analytics`): Performance reports and dashboards
- **Analyze → AI Analytics** (`/ai-analytics`): AI-powered insights
- **Dashboards** (`/dashboards`): Custom dashboards

## 6. Feature Dependency Chain

What must be set up before what:

```
Settings → Personal Mailboxes     ──→  Cold Outreach / Sequences (email steps)
Settings → Personal LinkedIn      ──→  Sequences (LinkedIn steps), Engage → LinkedIn
Settings → Value Prop Templates   ──→  Cold Outreach (AI uses these for messaging)
Settings → Email Campaign Settings ──→ Cold Outreach / Marketing Campaigns

Prospect → Find Leads             ──→  Save to List or CRM Leads
CRM → Lists                       ──→  Cold Outreach / Sequences (select leads from list)
CRM → Leads                       ──→  Deals pipeline

Add Apps (/market)                 ──→  Some sidebar items only appear after enabling the app
```

**Key dependencies:**
1. You MUST connect at least one mailbox before creating email outreach campaigns
2. You MUST connect LinkedIn before using LinkedIn sequence steps
3. Value Prop Templates improve Cold Outreach AI quality but aren't strictly required
4. Some sidebar sections (e.g., Voice Agents, Support, E-Sign) require enabling via **Add Apps** (`/market`) first
5. CRM custom objects appear in sidebar only after creation in CRM settings

## 8. How to Navigate

### To reach a page by URL (fastest):
Navigate directly: `browser_open https://sales.superagi.com<path>` using the URL map above.

### To reach an expandable sidebar section:
1. `browser_snapshot` to see the sidebar
2. Find the group with `right_arrow_small` icon (e.g., `StaticText "Prospect"`)
3. The group text is NOT a link ref — use `browser_eval` to click it:
   ```
   browser_eval: (function(){ const spans = document.querySelectorAll('span'); for(const s of spans){ if(s.textContent.trim()==='Prospect') { s.click(); return 'expanded'; }} return 'not found'; })()
   ```
4. `browser_snapshot` again — sub-items now appear as `link` refs (e.g., `link "Prospect Leads more_options" [ref=eNN]`)
5. Click the sub-item ref: `browser_click @eNN`

### To reach a direct link in sidebar:
1. `browser_snapshot` — find the link ref (e.g., `link "dashboards_icon Dashboards more_options" [ref=eNN]`)
2. `browser_click @eNN`

### To reach Settings:
- Direct: `browser_open https://sales.superagi.com/settings`
- Or: click AK avatar → Settings

## 9. Key Gotchas

1. **Sidebar group collapse**: Expanding one group collapses the previously expanded group. If you expanded "Engage" then click "Prospect", Engage sub-items disappear.

2. **Expandable groups are NOT link refs**: They appear as generic elements with `StaticText` + `right_arrow_small` image, not as clickable `link` refs. You must use `eval` with JS click or click the text content directly.

3. **Some sections need apps enabled first**: Items like Voice Agents, E-Sign, Support (inbound agent), etc. may not appear or may show empty states until enabled via Add Apps (`/market`).

4. **Settings page loads async**: After navigating to `/settings`, the settings sidebar and content load asynchronously. Wait 1-2 seconds before snapshotting.

5. **Refs become stale after navigation**: After clicking a link that changes the page URL, all previously captured `@eNN` refs are invalid. Always re-snapshot after navigation.

6. **Search navigates away**: Clicking the "Search SuperAGI" bar and typing will navigate to `/search` — you leave the current page. Use browser back or direct URL to return.

7. **Custom objects in CRM**: The CRM section may contain workspace-specific custom objects (e.g., `movies`, `test sources`, `Funnel`). These are NOT standard — they vary by workspace.

8. **URL inconsistency**: Some URLs don't follow a consistent pattern — e.g., Lists is `/list` (not `/crm/lists`), CRM Tasks is `/tasks` (not `/crm/tasks`), Unibox is `/unibox`. Always use the URL map above.
